# node-pulsar-admin-client

Missing admin client for Apache Pulsar. Autogenerated from Swagger definitions.

## Motivation

At the time of May 26, 2022, the official [Pulsar client for Node](https://github.com/apache/pulsar-client-node) doesn't support Pulsar admin API that can be used for editing tenants, namespaces, etc.

For our project we needed it to setup better test environment.

## Usage

```shell
npm i pulsar-admin-client
```

```typescript
import * as pulsarAdmin from "pulsar-admin-client";

const tenantsClient = new pulsarAdmin.TenantsApi("pulsar://localhost:6650");
await tenantsClient.createTenant("my-tenant");
```
