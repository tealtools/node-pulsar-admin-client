# node-pulsar-admin-client

Missing admin client for Apache Pulsar. Autogenerated from Swagger definitions.

## Motivation

The official [Pulsar client for Node](https://github.com/apache/pulsar-client-node) doesn't support Pulsar admin API that can be used for editing tenants, namespaces, etc.

For our project we needed it to setup better test environment.

## Usage

```shell
npm i @tealtools/pulsar-admin-client
```
